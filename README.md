# 🏦 Loan Eligibility Prediction – Case Study with SAS

This project simulates the automation of a loan approval system for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), modeled for a fictional company, *Lasiandra Finance Inc.* (LFI). Using SAS, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, missing value imputation, logistic regression modeling, and reporting.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To build a predictive system that improves loan approval efficiency by analyzing historical customer data and forecasting loan eligibility using SAS and ML algorithms.

---

## 🧠 Key Tasks Completed

- Created and documented a complete **data dictionary**
- Conducted **univariate & bivariate analysis** on both training and testing datasets
- **Imputed missing values** in categorical and continuous variables
- Built a **logistic regression model** in SAS to predict loan approval status
- Developed **data visualizations** (bar & pie charts) and **generated reports**
- Followed a structured **data pipeline** using SAS macros and libraries

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **SAS (Base + Macros)**
- PROC FREQ, PROC MEANS, PROC LOGISTIC, PROC REPORT
- Data Visualization (Bar, Pie Charts)
